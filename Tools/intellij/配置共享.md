# Share IDE settings

IntelliJ IDEA lets you share your IDE settings between different instances of the product, or among your team members. This helps you recreate a comfy working environment if you are working from different computers and spare the annoyance of things looking or behaving differently from what you are used to, or enforce the same standards throughout your team.

帮助重建舒适的工作环境，以避免不必要的烦恼，如不同电脑间的配置统一，团队人员间的配置标准统一。

For information on how to share settings related to specific projects, see [Share project settings through VCS](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-managing-projects.html#share-project-through-vcs).

You can share your IDE settings by using one of the following:

- [IDE Settings Sync](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#IDE_settings_sync): it utilizes the JetBrains server, so no additional configuration is required. Note that synced settings are linked to your [JetBrains Account](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208459005-What-is-JetBrains-Account-), so they will not be available to other team members, and are only useful to share settings between different IDE instances used by you.

  因为用到了账号，这个方式只能自己使用。

  The settings you can sync include: IDE themes, keymaps, color schemes, system settings, UI settings, menus and toolbars settings, project view settings, editor settings, code completion settings, parameter name hints, live templates, code styles, and the list of enabled and disabled plugins.

- [settings repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository): it allows you to sync any configurable components (except for the list of enabled and disabled plugins), but requires setting up a Git repository with the settings you want to share.

  This option is useful if you want to implement the same settings among your team-members.

- [exporting](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#import-export-settings) the settings you want to share as a ZIP archive and then importing them to a different IDE installation. You can export you code style settings, Git settings, including registered GitHub accounts, the Debugger settings, Registry keys, look and feel, and more.
