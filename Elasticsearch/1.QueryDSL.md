## match_phrase query

Like the match query but used for matching exact phrases or word proximity matches.

## multi_match query

The multi-field version of the match query. 

## common_terms query

A more specialized query which gives more preference to uncommon words.

## simple_query_string

A simpler, more robust version of the query_string syntax suitable for exposing directly to users.
