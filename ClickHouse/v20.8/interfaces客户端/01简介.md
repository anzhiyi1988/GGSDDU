ClickHouse provides two network interfaces (both can be optionally wrapped in TLS for additional security):

- [HTTP](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/http/), which is documented and easy to use directly.
- [Native TCP](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/tcp/), which has less overhead.

In most cases it is recommended to use appropriate tool or library instead of interacting with those directly. Officially supported by Yandex are the following:

- [Command-line client](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/cli/)
- [JDBC driver](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/jdbc/)
- [ODBC driver](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/odbc/)
- [C++ client library](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/cpp/)

There are also a wide range of third-party libraries for working with ClickHouse:

- [Client libraries](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/third-party/client-libraries/)
- [Integrations](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/third-party/integrations/)
- [Visual interfaces](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/interfaces/third-party/gui/)
